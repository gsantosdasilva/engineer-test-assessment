# Car Dealer App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It allows users to filter vehicles by type and model year and view the results on a separate page.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-dealer-app.git
   cd car-dealer-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

2. **Open the application:**

   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Building the Application

To create an optimized production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

### Running the Production Build

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project to store environment variables, such as API keys:

```env
# .env.local
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Code Quality

This project uses ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency.

1. **ESLint Configuration:**

   The `.eslintrc.js` file is configured to use ESLint with React and Prettier:

   ```js
   // .eslintrc.js
   module.exports = {
     root: true,
     extends: [
       'eslint:recommended',
       'plugin:react/recommended',
       'plugin:prettier/recommended',
     ],
     parserOptions: {
       ecmaVersion: 2020,
       sourceType: 'module',
     },
     rules: {
       'prettier/prettier': 'error',
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Prettier Configuration:**

   The `.prettierrc` file is configured with the following options:

   ```json
   // .prettierrc
   {
     "singleQuote": true,
     "trailingComma": "es5",
     "semi": true,
     "tabWidth": 2
   }
   ```

### Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Ensure you have configured Tailwind CSS as follows:

1. **Install Tailwind CSS:**

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

   Update `tailwind.config.js` to include your project’s paths:

   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind directives to your CSS:**

   Update `styles/globals.css`:

   ```css
   /* styles/globals.css */
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
